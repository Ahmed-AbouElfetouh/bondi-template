I built this project using (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap-5-).

Not a fancy design but, In that project you will see How i can use every Bootstrap's classes In the right place and this reduces the use of CSS file. And also you will see how i can use Bootstrap's components like card, Finally i use Bootstrap's Grid system to make the design fully responsive.
